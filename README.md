Blocipedia is a web app I'm building to learn web development using Rails.

You can find it here https://viral-blocipedia.herokuapp.com/

This app lets users create personal wikis and share them publicly or privately with other collaborators

I am receiving generous help from my mentor Dalibor Ilijevski.

Please check back to see my progress.  I will push at least every couple of days.
